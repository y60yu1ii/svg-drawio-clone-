# SVG Drawio clone

This is side-project is based on an idea that I could acutally build a drawio clone with pure svg and the vue I love.

It also included some of the result from other projects, where the notes were taken from latest conversation that how to leverage the power off multi-stage docker build to build a smallest static site.
